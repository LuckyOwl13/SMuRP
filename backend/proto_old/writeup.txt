The surprise package has algorithms that either use baseline estimates or a similarity measure.

Baseline estimates can be computed using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Alternating Least Squares (ALS)

As for similarity measure configuration, you input the sim_options into the argument when you create the algorithm:
sim_options has following keys:
    name         name of similarity to use, default is MSD
    user_based   whether similarities will be computed between users or between items - has LARGE impact on performance of algorithm, default is true
    min_support  min number of common items when user_based=true, otherwise min number of common users
    shrinkage    default is 100

SVD - Single Value Decomposition

"SVD is an algorithm that decomposes a matrix A into the best lower rank approximation of the original matrix A.
